The latest version of Process Analysis Toolkit can be downloaded from the official website at http://pat.comp.nus.edu.sg/?page_id=2587. An account will need to be created to download from the website. 


Installation instructions (taken from the official website - http://pat.comp.nus.edu.sg/?page_id=2587):

1. Installing PAT 3.x in Windows XP, Vista and Windows Server 2000/2003, Windows 7:

Installing PAT is easy: run the setup file and follow the steps in the installation wizard. The following are the system requirements:

* Windows Operating System: Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows Server 2000/2003.
* .NET Framework 4.0 is needed to run PAT.


2. Installing PAT 3.x in Linux, Unix, Mac OS or more - please follow these steps:

* You should install the tool 'Mono' in your system - it is freely available. Please download from (http://www.mono-project.com/download/) according to your OS. Note that libmono-winforms2.0-cil (plus its dependencies) may need be added in order to run PAT under Linux (Ubuntu).

* Download PAT 3.x. But choose the directly executable version to be downloaded to some place in your computer.

* In your computer, start the terminal application, use the command cd to change to the directory where you put “PAT 3.exe”;
    
* Type the command mono “PAT 3.exe” into terminal.(You might need to add execute permission as chmod +x “./PAT 3.exe”) Bingo! You will see the GUI of our PAT.

* Currently the latest mono 2.10.x has some problem on Mac, if you meet some error related to winforms, please use the mono-2.6.7 which is available at (http://www.mono-project.com/docs/about-mono/releases/2.6.7/).

Note: PAT runs faster in Windows than other OS. The reason for this is that mono is not as fast as native .NET framework.
